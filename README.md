# Premise
<p>The owner and sole pilot of Amazing Space, an independent shipper making deliveries across the galaxy. On the way back to the primary Mars settlement, a failure in your shielding allows a piece of space debris to damage the wizzlewhat that runs your FTL engine. Unable to continue travel, you find the nearest space station and limp towards it on what remains of your fuel.</p>

Unable to continue travel, you find the nearest space station and limp towards it on what remains of your fuel.</p>
<p>You must dodge and fight zombies, refuel, and procure the single part you need to repair the damage to your FTL engine and get out of Dodge. Unfortunately, the lever to start the refuel process has been detached and is nowhere to be seen, and the wizzlewhat is who even knows where, and there aren’t many non-zombies around to help you find either one.</p>
<p>Good luck. They’re Samurais, after all, and they plan to eat you.</p>

# Game Play
<p>The winning strategy is to locate the lever, return to the dock, reattach, and pull the lever. Then, go to the repair shop to procure the wizzlewhat, and return to the ship to make the repair and get out of Dodge.</p>
