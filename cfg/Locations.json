    "Description": "You're located in the Landing Dock. To the west you notice an escape dock littered with debris. To the East you find a beat up repair shop, advertising \"Their low prices are to die for\". South of you, you'll find your ship. There's some smoke coming out of the FTL engine. You curse the stupid space debris for damaging your craft while you search for a repair."

    "west": "Landing Dock",
    "NPC": "Engineer",
    "Item": ["Wizzlewhat", "Space Wrench"],
    "Description": "Inside the shop you see repair parts knocked over on the ground. There's blood smeared behind a counter (someone must have had a bad accident). You take a step forward and hear the sound of a tool hit the ground. You quickly glance over and see a pair of eyes behind a stack of RAD boosters."

    "Description": "There's space music playing on the jukebox. The tables near the exit are stacked on each other, some broken cleanly in half. Grabbing a drink from the bar doesn't sound like a bad idea."

    "east": "Central Hub",
    "NPC": "Visitor",
    "Item": ["Health Kit", "Lever"],
    "Description": "The smell of iron fills the room. The walls are painted red and there's a few bodies laying on the ground. There are medical supply boxes on the ground and some on the shelves, all empty. There may be more to find towards the back of the room."
