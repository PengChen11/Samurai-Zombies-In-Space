During a standard delivery run between a remote post in the Antares system and the primary Mars settlement, a piece of space debris evaded your ship’s shielding and damaged your FTL drive. You have just enough fuel for your engines to get you to Station X, where you can dock, refuel, fix your FTL drive, and get back on your way to Mars.

But as you approach Station X, there doesn’t appear to be any activity in its vicinity, and there’s no response from station control to your hails. You decide you have no choice but to stop here. There are no other options nearby, and you can’t afford Space AAA. You approach an empty docking port, even as your spidey sense tells you this could end badly.
